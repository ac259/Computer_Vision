# Computer Vision

## About
Contains programs that cover a wide variety of computer vision and image processing topics.
edge detection, key point detection, morpological transforms, k - means algorithm, SIFT features, epipolar lines,
diparity matrix, panaroma - image stitching and hough transforms. 

Some of the programs have been written from scratch to better understand the mechanics of the algorithms and concepts.
There are OpenCV functions alternatives too. 

## Requirements
I have used the following packages in it. It is recommended to have your setup using virtualenv. 
Below is a link on how to get the setup for the same.
(https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)

These are some of the main libraries that are used. 
opencv
numpy
matplotlib
shutil 
scipy
pillow

## Usage
Make sure that the data -original_imgs - contains all the input is present in the current working directory.

## Other Notes
Hough circle -  The accumulator for the lines can also be used for Hough circles.
